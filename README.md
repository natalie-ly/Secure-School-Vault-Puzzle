# Secure-School-Vault-Puzzle
## The Game
An escape room simulation that uses an STM-32 Nucleo Board. To solve the vault, players will enter a combination by turning the knob on the rotary encoders. The three rotary encoders represent a combination lock similar to those in schools. When the correct numbers are chosen, the light on the circuit board will flash a colour allowing
the players to know that they have been successful. A single-digit 7-segment display is used to display the current position of the “dial”. There is a buzzer system that indicates the time left for the player where there are short beeps every minute and one long beep once the time is up.
